    <p>This weekend, create an ADDRESS BOOK using the techniques we learned today. This is a very open-ended assignment, use whatever techniques you feel you need practice on to complete the requirements.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, create some other application which uses at least three constructor functions and is approximately the same scope as the address book.</p>

<p>Requirements for the ADDRESS BOOK:
	Store People and Businesses
	Search by name or phone number
    Add people or businesses to the address book</p>


<p>Reminder:
	C - create
	R - read
	U - update
    D - delete</p>
